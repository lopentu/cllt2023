If predictors are colinear, then removing one variable will have no influence on the point estimate of another variable's coefficient.\n\n    b.  Suppose a numerical predictor $x$ has a coefficient of $\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 2.5$ in a multiple regression model.\n        Suppose also that the first observation has $x_{1,1} = 7.2$, the second observation has a value of $x_{2,1} = 8.2$, and these two observations have the same values for all other predictors.\n        Then the predicted value of the second observation will be 2.5 higher than the prediction of the first observation based on the multiple regression model.\n\n    c.  If a regression model's first predictor has a coefficient of $\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 5.7$ and if we are able to influence the data so that an observation will have its $x_1$ be 1 larger than it would otherwise, the value $\\hat{y}_1$ for this observation would increase by 5.7.\n\n## Part 2 - Palmer penguins\n\nData were collected and made available by [Dr.Â Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).\n[@gorman2014]\n\n![Artwork by \\@allison_horst](images/lter_penguins.png)\n\nThese data can be found in the **palmerpenguins** package.\nWe're going to be working with the `penguins` dataset from this package.\nThe dataset contains data for 344 penguins.\nThere are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.\n\n5.  **Body mass.** Our first goal is to fit a model predicting body mass (which is more difficult to measure) from bill length, bill depth, flipper length, species, and sex.\n    a.  Fit a model predicting body mass (which is more difficult to measure) from the other variables listed above.\n\n    b.  Write the equation of the regression model.\n\n    c.  Interpret each one of the slopes in this context.\n\n    d.  Calculate the residual for a male Adelie penguin that weighs 3750 grams with the following body measurements: `bill_length_mm` = 39.1, `bill_depth_mm` = 18.7, `flipper_length_mm` = 181.\n        Does the model overpredict or underpredict this penguin's weight?\n\n    e.  Find the $R^2$ of this model and interpret this value in context of the data and the model.\n\n![](images/culmen_depth.png){style=\"float: right;\" width=\"300\"}\n\n6.  **Bill depth.** Next we'll be focusing on bill depth and bill length and also considering species.\n    a.  Fit a model predicting bill depth from bill length.\n        Find the adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC for this model.\n\n    b.  Then, add a new predictor: species.\n        Fit another model predicting bill depth from bill length and species.\n        Find the adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC for this model.\n\n    c.  Finally, add one more predictor: the interaction between bill length and species.\n        Find the adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC for this model.\n\n    d.  Using the three criteria you recorded for these three models, and with the goal of parsimony, which model is the \"best\" for predicting bill depth from bill length and/or species.\n        Explain your reasoning.\n\n    e.  Create a visualization representing your model from part a.\n        Hint: Make a scatterplot of bill depth vs. bill length and add the linear model.\n\n    f.  Create a visualization representing your model from part b.\n        Hint: Same as part (e), but think about how many lines to plot and whether their slopes should be the same or different.\n\n    g.  Create a visualization representing your model from part c.\n        Hint: Same as part (f), but think about how many lines to plot and whether their slopes should be the same or different.\n\n    h.  Based on your visualizations from parts e - g, and with the goal of parsimony, is your answer for which model is the \"best\" for predicting bill depth from bill length and/or species the same as your answer in part d?\n        Explain your reasoning.\n\n## Part 3 - Perceived threat of Covid-19\n\n@garbe2020, published in June 2020, aims to examine the relationship between personality traits, perceived threat of Covid-19 and stockpiling toilet paper.\nFor this study titled [Influence of perceived threat of Covid-19 and HEXACO personality traits on toilet paper stockpiling](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0234232#abstract0), researchers conducted an online survey March 23 - 29, 2020 and used the results to fit multiple linear regression models to draw conclusions about their research questions.\nFrom their survey, they collected data on adults across 35 countries.\nGiven the small number of responses from people outside of the United States, Canada, and Europe, only responses from people in these three locations were included in the regression analysis.\n\nLet's consider their results for the model looking at the effect on **perceived threat of Covid-19**.\nThe model can be found on page 6 of the paper.\nThe perceived threat of Covid was quantified using the responses to the following survey question:\n\n> How threatened do you feel by Coronavirus?\n> \\[Users select on a 10-point visual analogue scale (Not at all threatened to Extremely Threatened)\\]\n\n7.  Interpret the coefficient of Age (0.072) in the context of the analysis.\n\n8.  Interpret the coefficient of Place of residence in the context of the analysis.\n\n9.  The model includes an interaction between Place of residence and Emotionality (capturing differential tendencies in to worry and be anxious).\n\n    a.  What does the coefficient for the interaction (0.101) mean in the context of the data?\n\n    b.  Interpret the estimated effect of Emotionality for a person who lives in the US/Canada.\n\n    c.  Interpret the estimated effect of Emotionality for a person who lives in Europe.\n\n## Submission\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.\nWe will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.\n\nRemember -- you must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page before the submission deadline for full credit.\n:::\n\nTo submit your assignment:\n\n-   Go to [http://www.gradescope.com](http://www.gradescope.com/) and click *Log in* in the top right corner.\n-   Click *School Credentials* â¡ï¸ *Duke NetID* and log in using your NetID credentials.\n-   Click on your *STA 210* course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark the pages associated with each exercise.
