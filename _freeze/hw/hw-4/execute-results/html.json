The participant was required to make a decision (choose or don't choose) as each photo was shown. Once a decision was made, participants were not allowed to reexamine a photo. If the participant made an identification, the remaining photos were not shown. In each of these lineups the true perpetrator was always the 5<sup>th</sup> photo in the lineup.\n-   **`weapon`**: Whether or not a weapon was present in the video of the mock crime.\n-   **`feature`**: Whether or not the perpetrator had a distinctive marking on his face. In this experiment, the distinctive feature was a large \"N\" sticker on one cheek. (The letter \"N\" was chosen to represent the first author's alma mater - University of Nebraska.)\n\nThe data may be found in `eyewitness.csv` in the `data` folder.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\new <- read_csv(here::here(\"hw\", \"data/eyewitness.csv\"))\new <- ew %>%\n  mutate(id = as_factor(id))\n```\n:::\n\n## Exercises\n\n1.  Let's begin by doing some exploratory data analysis. The univariate (single variable) plots for each of the predictor variables and the response variable are shown below.\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hw-4_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nComplete the exploratory data analysis by creating the plots and/or summary statistics to examine the relationship between the response variable (`id`) and each of the explanatory variables (`lineup`, `weapon`, and `feature`).\n\n2.  Using the plots/tables from Exercise 1:\n\n-   What is one thing you learn about the data from the univariate plots?\n-   Based on the bivariate plots, do any of the predictors appear to have a significant effect on the `id`? Briefly explain.\n\n3.  Briefly explain why you should use a multinomial logistic regression model to predict `id` using `lineup`, `weapon` and `feature`.\n\n4.  Fit the multinomial logistic model that only includes main effects.\n    Display the model output.\n\n-   What is the baseline category for the response variable?\n-   Interpret the intercepts for each part of the model in terms of the odds.\n-   Interpret the coefficients of `lineup` for each part of the model in terms of the odds.\n\n5.  You want to consider all possible first-order interaction effects (interaction effects between two variables) for the model.\n\n-   Use the appropriate test to determine if there is at least one significant interaction effect.\n-   Based on your test, is there evidence of any significant interaction effects?\n\n*Regardless of your answer to Question 5, use the model that includes the interaction terms for the remainder of the assignment.*\n\n6.  According to the model,\n\n-   If there was no weapon but the perpetrator had a distinctive feature in the mock crime, how do the **log-odds** of reject vs. a correct ID change when there is a simultaneous lineup vs. a sequential lineup?\n-   If there was no weapon but the perpetrator had a distinctive feature in the mock crime, how do the **odds** of reject vs. a correct ID change when there is a simultaneous lineup vs. a sequential lineup?\n-   Which group of participants (i.e., which set of experimental conditions) is described by the intercept?\n\n7.  Are the conditions inference met?\n    List of the conditions, and, **if relevant**, create visualizations to check the conditions and evaluate whether each condition is met.\n    Include an assessment about each condition and a brief explanation about your conclusion.\n\n8.  Use the model to predict the decision made by each participant.\n    Make a table of the predicted vs. the actual decisions.\n\n-   Briefly describe how the predicted decision is determined for each participant.\n-   What is the misclassification rate?\n\n## Submission\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.\nWe will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.\n\nRemember -- you must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page before the submission deadline for full credit.\n:::\n\nTo submit your assignment:\n\n-   Go to [http://www.gradescope.com](http://www.gradescope.com/) and click *Log in* in the top right corner.\n-   Click *School Credentials* ➡️ *Duke NetID* and log in using your NetID credentials.\n-   Click on your *STA 210* course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark the pages associated with each exercise.
