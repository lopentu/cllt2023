Use age and education to predict if a randomly selected person will vote in the next election.\n\n2.  Use budget and run time (in minutes) to predict a movie's total revenue.\n\n3.  Use age and sex to calculate the probability a randomly selected adult will visit Duke Health in the next year.\n\n## Heart disease\n\n### Data: Framingham study\n\nThis data set is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.\nWe want to use the total cholesterol to predict if a randomly selected adult is high risk for heart disease in the next 10 years.\n\n-   `high_risk`:\n    -   1: High risk of having heart disease in next 10 years\n    -   0: Not high risk of having heart disease in next 10 years\n-   `totChol`: total cholesterol (mg/dL)\n\n### Outcome: `high_risk`\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = heart_disease, aes(x = high_risk)) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"1\" = \"High risk\", \"0\" = \"Low risk\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of 10-year risk of heart disease\", \n    x = NULL)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-9-odds_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheart_disease %>%\n  count(high_risk)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2 Ã— 2\n  high_risk     n\n  <fct>     <int>\n1 0          3555\n2 1           635\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n### Calculating probability and odds\n\n1.  What is the probability a randomly selected person in the study is **not** high risk for heart disease?\n\n2.  What are the **odds** a randomly selected person in the study is **not** high risk for heart disease?\n\n### Logistic regression model\n\nFit a logistic regression model to understand the relationship between total cholesterol and risk for heart disease.\n\nLet $pi$ be the probability an adult is high risk.\nThe statistical model is\n\n$$\\log\\Big(\\frac{\\pi_i}{1-\\pi_i}\\Big) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 TotChol_i$$\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nheart_disease_fit <- logistic_reg() %>%\n  set_engine(\"glm\") %>%\n  fit(high_risk ~ totChol, data = heart_disease, family = \"binomial\")\n\ntidy(heart_disease_fit) %>% kable(digits = 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|term        | estimate| std.error| statistic| p.value|\n|:-----------|--------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|\n|(Intercept) |   -2.894|     0.230|   -12.607|       0|\n|totChol     |    0.005|     0.001|     5.268|       0|\n:::\n:::\n\n3.  Write the regression equation. Round to 3 digits.\n\n### Calculating log-odds, odds and probabilities\n\nBased on the model, if a randomly selected person has a total cholesterol of 250 mg/dL,\n\n4.  What are the log-odds they are high risk for heart disease?\n\n5.  What are the odds they are high risk for heart disease?\n\n6.  What is the probability they are high risk for heart disease?\n    *Use the odds to calculate your answer.*\n\n### Comparing observations\n\nSuppose a person's cholesterol changes from 250 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL.\n\n7.  How do you expect the log-odds that this person is high risk for heart disease to change?\n\n8.  How do you expect the odds that this person is high risk for heart disease to change?",
