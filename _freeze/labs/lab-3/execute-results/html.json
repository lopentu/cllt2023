You can't use the same name as another team, so I encourage you to be creative! Your TA will get your team name by the end of lab.\n-   Fill out the team agreement. This will help you figure out a plan for communication and working together during labs and outside of lab times. You can find the team agreement in the GitHub repo **team-agreement-\\[github_team_name\\]**.\n-   Have **one person** from the team clone the repo and start a new RStudio project. This person will type the team's responses as you discuss the sections of the agreement. No one else in the team should type at this point but should be contributing to the discussion.\n-   Be sure to push the completed agreement to GitHub. Each team member can refer to the document in this repo or download the PDF of the agreement for future reference. You do **not** need to submit the agreement on Gradescope.\n\n## Getting started\n\n-   A repository has already been created for you and your teammates. Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.\n-   Go to the [sta210-s22](https://www.github.com/sta210-s22) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-3**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. **Do not make any changes to the `.qmd` file until the instructions tell you do to so.**\n\n## Workflow: Using Git and GitHub as a team\n\n::: callout-important\nAssign each person on your team a number 1 through 4.\nFor teams of three, Team Member 1 can take on the role of Team Member 4.\n:::\n\nThe following exercises must be done in order.\n**Only one person should type in the `.qmd` file, commit, and push updates at a time.** When it is not your turn to type, you should still share ideas and contribute to the team's discussion.\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n‚å®Ô∏è **Team Member 1: Hands on the keyboard.**\n\nüôÖüèΩ All other team members: Hands off the keyboard until otherwise instructed![^1]\n:::\n\n[^1]: Don't trust yourself to keep your hands off the keyboard?\n    Put them in your picket or cross your arms.\n    No matter how silly it might feel, resist the urge to touch your keyboard until otherwise instructed!\n\nChange the author to your team name and include each team member's name in the `author` field of the YAML in the following format: `Team Name: Member 1, Member 2, Member 3, Member 4`.\n\n::: render-commit-push\n**Team Member 1:** Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF.\nThen, commit (with an informative commit message) both the `.qmd` and PDF documents, and finally push the changes to GitHub.\n:::\n\n::: pull\n**Team Members 2, 3, 4:** Once Team Member 1 is done rendering, committing, and pushing, confirm that the changes are visible on GitHub in your team's lab repo.\nThen, in RStudio, click the **Pull** button in the Git pane to get the updated document.\nYou should see the updated name in your `.qmd` file.\n:::\n\n## Packages\n\nThe following packages are used in the lab.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ggfortify)\n```\n:::\n\n## Data: Coffee ratings\n\nThe dataset for this lab comes from the [Coffee Quality Database](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database) and was obtained from the [#TidyTuesday GitHub repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/readme.md).\nIt includes information about the origin, producer, measures of various characteristics, and the quality measure for over 1000 coffees.\n\nThis lab will focus on the following variables:\n\n-   `aroma`: Aroma grade, 0 - 10 scale\n-   `total_cup_points`: Measure of quality, 0 - 100 scale\n\nYou can find the definitions for all variables in the data set [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-07/readme.md).\n[Click here](http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&d=cupping-protocols&mod=article_inline) for more details about how these measures are obtained.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncoffee_ratings <- read_csv(\"data/coffee_ratings.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n## Exercises\n\n::: callout-note\n-   Include axis labels and an informative title for all plots.\n-   Use the `kable` function to neatly print tables and regression output.

If so, how many? Briefly explain, including any output, graphs, etc. you used to determine the response. Improve your plot by adding a new year to draw a vertical line (with `geom_vline()`) at the value of the threshold you're using to determine which points have high leverage.\n\n::: render-commit-push\n**Team Member 2:** Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF.\nThen, commit (with an informative commit message) both the `.qmd` and PDF documents, and finally push the changes to GitHub.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n:::\n\n::: pull\n**Team Members 1, 3, 4:** Once Team Member 2 is done rendering, committing, and pushing, confirm that the changes are visible on GitHub in your team's lab repo.\nThen, in RStudio, click the **Pull** button in the Git pane to get the updated document.\nYou should see the responses to Exercises 3 and 4 in your `.qmd` file.\n:::\n\n<br>\n\nNow it's time for another hand off...\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n‚å®Ô∏è **Team Member 3: Hands on the keyboard. Write the answers to Exercises 5.**\n\nüôÖüèΩ All other team members: Hands off the keyboard until otherwise instructed!\n:::\n\n### Exercise 5\n\nAnother standard model diagnostic involves identifying points that don't fit the pattern from the regression line.\nWe do this by determining which points have large **standardized** residuals (residual divided by the standard error of residuals).\n\n$$\nStd.~res_i = \\frac{y_i - \\hat{y}_1}{\\hat{\\sigma}_\\epsilon ~ \\sqrt{1 - h_i}},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_\\epsilon$ is the regression standard error.\n\n::: callout-note\nThese values are already calculated in the output of `augment()`.\n:::\n\nObservations that have standardized residuals of large magnitude (usually beyond $\\pm$ 3) are potential outliers, since they don't fit the pattern determined by the regression model.\nTherefore, a common practice is to plot standardized residuals vs. fitted values, to make it easier to identify outliers.\n\nWe can obtain this plot with the following:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nautoplot(coffee_fit$fit, which = 3)\n```\n:::\n\nCreate this visualization and horizontal lines (with `geom_hline()`) at the cutoff values for \"large\" standardized residuals ($\\pm$ 3).\nAre there any such points in the data?\nIf so, how many?\nBriefly explain, including any output, graphs, etc. you used to determine the response.\n\n::: render-commit-push\n**Team Member 3:** Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF.\nThen, commit (with an informative commit message) both the `.qmd` and PDF documents, and finally push the changes to GitHub.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n:::\n\n::: pull\n**Team Members 1, 2, 4:** Once Team Member 3 is done rendering, committing, and pushing, confirm that the changes are visible on GitHub in your team's lab repo.\nThen, in RStudio, click the **Pull** button in the Git pane to get the updated document.\nYou should see the responses to Exercise 5 and 4 in your `.qmd` file.\n:::\n\n<br>\n\nNow it's time for another hand off...\n\n::: {.callout-important appearance=\"simple\"}\n‚å®Ô∏è **Team Member 4: Hands on the keyboard. Write the answers to Exercises 6.**\n\nüôÖüèΩ All other team members: Hands off the keyboard until otherwise instructed!\n:::\n\n### Exercise 6\n\nFinally, we'll examine Cook's Distance.\nAn observation's influence on the regression line depends on how close it lies to the general trend of the data (i.e., its standardized residual) and it's leverage ($h_i$).\n**Cook's Distance** is a statistic that includes both of these components to measure an observation's overall impact on the model.\nCook's Distance for the $i^{th}$ observation is defined as the follows:\n\n$$\nD_i = \\frac{(std.~res)^2}{p + 1} (\\frac{h_i}{1-\\frac{h_i})\n$$\\\nAn observation with large $D_i$ is said to have a strong influence on the predicted values.\nOn that scale,\n\n-   $D_i$ \\> 0.5 is **moderately influential**\n-   $D_i$ \\> 1 is **very influential**\n\nWe can plot of Cook's distances vs. the observation number with the following:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nautoplot(coffee_fit$fit, which = 4, ncol = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab-3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nStandardized residuals, leverage, and Cook's Distance should all be examined together.\nSo what do we do with observations identified as outliers or leverage points?\n\nIt is **OK** to drop an observation based on the **predictor variables** if...\n\n-   It is meaningful to drop the observation given the context of the problem\n\n-   You intended to build a model on a smaller range of the predictor variables.\n    You should mention this in the write up of the results and be careful to avoid extrapolation when making predictions.\n\nIt is **not OK** to drop an observation based on the response variable if...\n\n-   These are legitimate observations and should be in the model.\n-   You can try transformations or increasing the sample size by collecting more data.\n\nSo lastly, let's analyze Cook's D to determine if there are influential points in the data.\n\n-   Based on Cook's D, are there any influential points in our data? Briefly explain, including any output, graphs, etc. you used to determine the response.\n-   If there are influential points, briefly explain why they are outliers, i.e., not in the trend of the rest of the data.\n-   If there are influential points, remove those points from the data and refit the model. How do the model coefficients change, if at all?\n-   If there are influential points, would you recommend using the model fit with or without these points for inferential conclusions and predictions? Briefly explain why or why not. Additionally, briefly explain potential impacts your choice has on inferential conclusions and/or predictions.\n\n::: render-commit-push\n**Team Member 4:** Render the document and confirm that the changes are visible in the PDF.\nThen, commit (with an informative commit message) both the `.qmd` and PDF documents, and finally push the changes to GitHub.\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n:::\n\n::: pull\n**Team Members 1, 2, 3:** Once Team Member 4 is done rendering, committing, and pushing, confirm that the changes are visible on GitHub in your team's lab repo.\nThen, in RStudio, click the **Pull** button in the Git pane to get the updated document.\nYou should see the responses to Exercise 6 and 4 in your `.qmd` file.\n:::\n\n<br>\n\nNow it's time for one last hand off...\n\n## Wrapping up\n\n::: callout-important\n‚å®Ô∏è **Team Member 2: Hands on the keyboard.
