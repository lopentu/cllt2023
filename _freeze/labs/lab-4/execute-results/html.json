Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.\n-   Go to the [sta210-s22](https://www.github.com/sta210-s22) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-4**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\n-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. Throughout the lab, each person should get a chance to make commits and push to the repo.\n\n## Packages\n\nThe following packages are used in the lab.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(schrute)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n:::\n\n## Data: The Office\n\nThe dataset for this lab comes from the [schrute](https://bradlindblad.github.io/schrute/) package and it's called `theoffice`.\nThis dataset contains the entire script transcriptions from The Office.\n\nLet's start by taking a peek at the data.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(theoffice)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 55,130\nColumns: 12\n$ index            <int> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16…\n$ season           <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,…\n$ episode          <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,…\n$ episode_name     <chr> \"Pilot\", \"Pilot\", \"Pilot\", \"Pilot\", \"Pilot\", \"Pilot\",…\n$ director         <chr> \"Ken Kwapis\", \"Ken Kwapis\", \"Ken Kwapis\", \"Ken Kwapis…\n$ writer           <chr> \"Ricky Gervais;Stephen Merchant;Greg Daniels\", \"Ricky…\n$ character        <chr> \"Michael\", \"Jim\", \"Michael\", \"Jim\", \"Michael\", \"Micha…\n$ text             <chr> \"All right Jim.

Identify episodes where the word \"halloween\", \"valentine\", or \"christmas\" were ever mentioned, using variables you created above.\n-   Task 2. Calculate the percentage of lines spoken by Jim, Pam, Michael, and Dwight for each episode of The Office.\n\nBelow are some instructions and starter code to get you started with these tasks.\n\n-   Start by grouping `theoffice` data by `season`, `episode`, `episode_name`, `imdb_rating`, `total_votes`, and `air_date`. (These variables, except for `season` have the same value for each given episode, hence grouping by them allows us to make sure they appear in the output of this pipeline.)\n-   Use `summarize()` to calculate the desired features at the season-episode level.\n-   Task 1:\n    -   Calculate the number of lines per season per episode, you might name this new variable `n_lines`.\n    -   Then, calculate the proportion of lines in that episode spoken by each of the four `character`s Jim, Pam, Michael, and Dwight. Name these new variables `lines_jim`, `lines_pam`, `lines_michael`, and `lines_dwight`, respectively.\n-   Task 2:\n    -   Create a variable called `halloween` that sums up the `1`s in `halloween_mention` at the season-episode level and takes on the value `\"yes\"` if the sum is greater than or equal to 1, or `\"no\"` otherwise.\n    -   Do something similar for new variables `valentine` and `christmas` as well based on values from `valentine_mention` and `christmas_mention`.\n-   Finish up your `summarize()` statement by dropping the groups, so the resulting data frame is no longer grouped and remove `n_lines` (we won't use that variable in our analysis, we only calculated it as an intermediary step).\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noffice_episodes <- theoffice %>%\n  group_by(___) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_lines = n(),\n    lines_jim = sum(character == \"___\") / n_lines,\n    lines_pam = ___,\n    lines_michael = ___,\n    lines_dwight = ___,\n    halloween = if_else(sum(___) >= 1, \"yes\", \"no\"),\n    valentine = if_else(___, \"___\", \"___\"),\n    christmas = if_else(___, \"___\", \"___\"),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  select(-n_lines)\n```\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nWhy `summarize()` and not `mutate()`?\nWe use `mutate()` to add / modify a column of a data frame.\nThe output data frame always has the same number of rows as the input data frame.\nOn the other hand, we use `summarize()` to reduce the data frame to either a single row (single summary statistic) or one row per each group (summary statistics at the group level).\n\nAnd what about that `.groups` argument in summarize?\nTry running your `summarize()` step without it first.\nYou'll see that R print out a message saying *\"`summarize()` has grouped output by `season`, `episode`. You can override using the `.groups` argument.\"* `summarize()` will only drop the last group.\nSo if you want a data frame that doesn't have a grouping structure as a result of a `summaerize()`, you can explicitly ask for that with `.groups = \"drop\"`.\nBefore you proceed, read the [documentation for `summarize()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html), and specifically the explanation for the `.groups` argument to prepare yourself for future instances where you might see this type of message.\n:::\n\n#### Exercise 3\n\nThe Michael Scott character (played by Steve Carrell) left the show at the end of Season 7.\nAdd an indicator variable, `michael`, that takes on the value `\"yes\"` if Michael Scott (Steve Carrell) was in the show, and `\"no\"` if not.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noffice_episodes <- office_episodes %>%\n  mutate(michael = if_else(season > ___, \"___\", \"___\"))\n```\n:::\n\n#### Exercise 4\n\nPrint out the dimensions (`dim()`) of the new dataset you created as well as the `names()` of the columns in the dataset.\n\nYour new dataset, `office_episodes,` should have 186 rows and 14 columns.\nThe column names should be `season`, `episode`, `episode_name`, `imdb_rating`, `total_votes`, `air_date`, `lines_jim`, `lines_pam`, `lines_michael`, `lines_dwight`, `halloween`, `valentine`, `christmas`, and `michael`.\nIf you are not matching these numbers or columns, go back and try to figure out where you went wrong.\nOr ask your TA for help!\n\n::: render-commit-push\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab repo on GitHub.\nClick the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you've made, write an informative commit message, and push.\nAfter you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\nIt's also a good place to let another team member take over the keyboard!\nA team member who hasn't done so yet should pull the changes and make the commits for the next few exercises.\n:::\n\n### Exploratory data analysis\n\nThis would be a good place to conduct some exploratory data analysis (EDA).\nFor example, plot the proportion of lines spoken by each character over time.\nOr calculate the percentage of episodes that mention Halloween, or Valentine's Day, or Christmas.\nGiven we have limited time in the lab we're not going to ask you to report EDA results as part of this lab, but we're noting this here to provide suggestions for how you might go about structuring your project.\n\n### Modeling prep\n\n#### Exercise 5\n\nSplit the data into training (75%) and testing (25%).\nSave the training and testing data as `office_train` and `office_test` respectively.\n\n*Naming suggestion:* Call the initial split `office_split`, the training data `office_train`, and testing data `office_test`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(123)\noffice_split <- ___(office_episodes)\noffice_train <- ___(office_split)\noffice_test <- ___(___)\n```\n:::\n\n#### Exercise 6\n\nSpecify a linear regression model with engine `\"lm\"` and call it `office_spec`.\n\n*Naming suggestion:* Call the model specification `office_spec`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noffice_spec <- ___\n```\n:::\n\n#### Exercise 7\n\nCreate a recipe that performs feature engineering using the following steps (in the given order):\n\n-   `update_role()`: updates the role of `episode_name` to not be a predictor (be an ID)\n-   `step_rm()`: removes `air_date` as a predictor\n-   `step_dummy()`: creates dummy variables for `all_nominal_predictors()`\n-   `step_zv()`: removes all zero variance predictors\n\n*Naming suggestion:* Call the recipe `office_rec`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noffice_rec <- recipe(imdb_rating ~ ., data = office_train) %>%\n  ___\n```\n:::\n\n::: render-commit-push\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab repo on GitHub.\nClick the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you've made, write an informative commit message, and push.\nAfter you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\nIt's also a good place to let another team member take over the keyboard!\nA team member who hasn't done so yet should pull the changes and make the commits for the next few exercises.\n:::\n\n#### Exercise 8\n\nBuild a model workflow for fitting the model specified earlier and using the recipe you developed to preprocess the data.\n\n*Naming suggestion:* Call the model workflow `office_wflow`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noffice_wflow <- workflow() %>%\n  add_model(___) %>%\n  add_recipe(___)\n```\n:::\n\n### Model fit and evaluation\n\n#### Exercise 9\n\nFit the model to training data, neatly display the model output, and interpret two of the slope coefficients.\n\n*Naming suggestion:* Call the model fit `office_fit`.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noffice_fit <- office_wflow %>%\n  fit(data = ___)\n\n___\n```\n:::\n\n#### Exercise 10\n\nCalculate predicted `imdb_rating` for the training data using the `predict()` function.\nThen, bind two columns from the training data to this result: `imdb_rating` and `episode_name`.\nThe resulting data frame should have three columns: `.pred`, `imdb_rating`, and `episode_name`.\nThen, using this data frame, create a scatterplot of predicted and observed IMDB ratings for the training data.\n\n*Naming suggestion:* Call the resulting data frame `office_train_pred`.\n\n*Stretch goal.* Add episode names, using `geom_text()`, for episodes with much higher and much lower observed IMDB ratings compared to others.\n\n#### Exercise 11\n\nCalculate the R-squared and RMSE for this model for predictions on the training data.\n\n::: render-commit-push\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your remote lab repo on GitHub.\nClick the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you've made, write an informative commit message, and push.\nAfter you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\nIt's also a good place to let another team member take over the keyboard!\nA team member who hasn't done so yet should pull the changes and make the commits for the next few exercises.\n:::\n\n#### Exercise 12\n\nRepeat Exercise 10, but with testing data.\n\n*Naming suggestion:* Call the resulting data frame `office_test_pred`.\n\n#### Exercise 13\n\nBased on your visualization on Exercise 12, speculate on whether you expect the R-squared and RMSE for this model to be higher or lower for predictions on the testing data compared to those on the training data, or do you expect them to be the same?\nExplain your reasoning.\n\n#### Exercise 14\n\nCheck your intuition in Exercise 13 by actually calculating the R-squared and RMSE for this model for predictions on the training data.\nComment on whether your intuition is confirmed or not.\n\n## Submission\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.\nWe will be checking these to make
