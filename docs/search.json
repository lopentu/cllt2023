Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.\nMake sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team members).\nAll team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and group assessments will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment works."

The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES!

This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) %&gt;%\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document."

    "text": "Hat Matrix & Leverage\nRecall from the notes Matrix Form of Linear Regression that \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) can be written as the following:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nCombining Equation 4 and Equation 5, we can write \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}\\) as the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} &= \\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nWe define the hat matrix as an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix of the form \\(\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\). Thus Equation 6 becomes\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y}\n\\tag{7}\\]\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix are a measure of how far the predictor variables of each observation are from the means of the predictor variables. For example, \\(h_{ii}\\) is a measure of how far the values of the predictor variables for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation, \\(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ip}\\), are from the mean values of the predictor variables, \\(\\bar{x}_1, \\bar{x}_2, \\ldots, \\bar{x}_p\\). In the case of simple linear regression, the \\(i^{th}\\) diagonal, \\(h_{ii}\\), can be written as\n\\[\nh_{ii} =  \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_j-\\bar{x})^2}\n\\]\nWe call these diagonal elements, the leverage of each observation.\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix have the following properties:\n\n\\(0 \\leq h_ii \\leq 1\\)\n\\(\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii} = p+1\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of predictor variables in the model.\nThe mean hat value is \\(\\bar{h} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii}}{n} = \\frac{p+1}{n}\\).\n\nUsing these properties, we consider a point to have high leverage if it has a leverage value that is more than 2 times the average. In other words, observations with leverage greater than \\(\\frac{2(p+1)}{n}\\) are considered to be high leverage points, i.e. outliers in the predictor variables. We are interested in flagging high leverage points, because they may have an influence on the regression coefficients.\nWhen there are high leverage points in the data, the regression line will tend towards those points; therefore, one property of high leverage points is that they tend to have small residuals. We will show this by rewriting the residuals from Equation 4 using Equation 7.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{e} &= \\mathbf{Y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y} \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{Y}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nNote that the identity matrix and hat matrix are idempotent, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{I}\\), \\(\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{H}\\). Thus, \\((\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{H})\\) is also idempotent. These matrices are also symmetric. Using these properties and Equation 8, we have that the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals \\(\\boldsymbol{e}\\), is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nVar(\\mathbf{e}) &= \\mathbf{e}\\mathbf{e}^T \\\\[10pt]\n&=  (1-\\mathbf{H})Var(\\mathbf{Y})^T(1-\\mathbf{H})^T \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})^T  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})(1-\\mathbf{H})  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{9}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i^2}{n-p-1}\\) is the estimated regression variance. Thus, the variance of the \\(i^{th}\\) residual is \\(Var(e_i) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-h_{ii})\\). Therefore, the higher the leverage, the smaller the variance of the residual. Because the expected value of the residuals is 0, we conclude that points with high leverage tend to have smaller residuals than points with lower leverage."

    "section": "Maximum Likelihood Estimation of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma\\)",
    "text": "Maximum Likelihood Estimation of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma\\)\nTo understand the formulas for AIC and BIC, we will first briefly explain the likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimates for regression.\nLet \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) be \\(n \\times 1\\) matrix of responses, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), the \\(n \\times (p+1)\\) matrix of predictors, and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), \\((p+1) \\times 1\\) matrix of coefficients. If the multiple linear regression model is correct then,\n\\[\n\\mathbf{Y} \\sim N(\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWhen we do linear regression, our goal is to estimate the unknown parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) from Equation 1. In Matrix Notation for Multiple Linear Regression, we showed a way to estimate these parameters using matrix alegbra. Another approach for estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is using maximum likelihood estimation.\nA likelihood function is used to summarise the evidence from the data in support of each possible value of a model parameter. Using Equation 1, we will write the likelihood function for linear regression as\n\\[\nL(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n (2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\exp\\bigg\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\bigg\\}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(Y_i\\) is the \\(i^{th}\\) response and \\(\\mathbf{X}_i\\) is the vector of predictors for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation. One approach estimating \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) is to find the values of those parameters that maximize the likelihood in Equation 2, i.e. maximum likelhood estimation. To make the calculations more manageable, instead of maximizing the likelihood function, we will instead maximize its logarithm, i.e. the log-likelihood function. The values of the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood function are those that maximize the likelihood function. The log-likelihood function we will maximize is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log L(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) &= \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n -\\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{n}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are \\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y} \\hspace{10mm} \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\frac{1}{n}RSS\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere \\(RSS\\) is the residual sum of squares. Note that the maximum likelihood estimate is not exactly equal to the estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) we typically use \\(\\frac{RSS}{n-p-1}\\). This is because the maximum likelihood estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\) in Equation 4 is a biased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\). When \\(n\\) is much larger than the number of predictors \\(p\\), then the differences in these two estimates are trivial."

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.1.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install a daily build of RStudio: https://dailies.rstudio.com/\nInstall Quarto CLI: https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."
